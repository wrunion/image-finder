# All The API Calls!

#### A single-page JavaScript app built with Webpack, to practice various types of API calls, 2/20/2020

#### By **Kent P. McKinney and Winter A. Runion**

### Dev Notes/To Do
* Bootstrap isn't working with webpack. I inserted it into the index as a CDN - we need to go back and fix that.
* The custom fonts are currently just linked in the index head section. 
  * Find out if it's best practice to link them, or to download them.
  * If it's best practice to DL, figure out how webkit manages fonts. 
  * We probably need an extra extension for that.
* If we haven't already, install an extension for managing images. I don't think we have one now.  

### Kent Notes
